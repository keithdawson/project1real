summary of the union and national politics during the strenuous period between the establishment of american independence and the advent of jacksonian democracy the great american experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it  all the presidents in that period  except john quincy adams  had taken part in the revolution  james madison  the chief author of the constitution  lived until 1836  this age  therefore  was the  age of the fathers   it saw the threatened ruin of the country under the articles of confederation  the formation of the constitution  the rise of political parties  the growth of the west  the second war with england  and the apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism  the new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles began  the government could not raise money to pay its debts or running expenses  it could not protect american commerce and manufactures against european competition  it could not stop the continual issues of paper money by the states  it could not intervene to put down domestic uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments  without money  without an army  without courts of law  the union under the articles of confederation was drifting into dissolution  patriots  who had risked their lives for independence  began to talk of monarchy again  washington  hamilton  and madison insisted that a new constitution alone could save america from disaster  by dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced the congress to call a national convention to take into account the state of america  in may  1787  it assembled at philadelphia and for months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution  the small states clamored for equal rights in the union  the large states vowed that they would never grant it  a spirit of conciliation  fair play  and compromise saved the convention from breaking up  in addition  there were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states  here  too  compromises had to be worked out  some of the delegates feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it  these factions also had to be placated  at last a plan of government was drafted  the constitution of the united states  and submitted to the states for approval  only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states ratify the instrument to put it into effect  on april 30  1789  george washington was inaugurated first president  the new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation  assume the debts of the states  found a national bank  lay heavy taxes to pay the bills  and enact laws protecting american industry and commerce  hamilton led the way  but he had not gone far before he encountered opposition  he found a formidable antagonist in jefferson  in time two political parties appeared full armed upon the scene  the federalists and the republicans  for ten years they filled the country with political debate  in 1800 the federalists were utterly vanquished by the republicans with jefferson in the lead  by their proclamations of faith the republicans favored the states rather than the new national government  but in practice they added immensely to the prestige and power of the nation  they purchased louisiana from france  they waged a war for commercial independence against england  they created a second united states bank  they enacted the protective tariff of 1816  they declared that congress had power to abolish slavery north of the missouri compromise line  and they spread the shield of the monroe doctrine between the western hemisphere and europe  still america was a part of european civilization  currents of opinion flowed to and fro across the atlantic  friends of popular government in europe looked to america as the great exemplar of their ideals  events in europe reacted upon thought in the united states  the french revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political debate  while it was in the stage of mere reform all americans favored it  when the king was executed and a radical democracy set up  american opinion was divided  when france fell under the military dominion of napoleon and preyed upon american commerce  the united states made ready for war  the conduct of england likewise affected american affairs  in 1793 war broke out between england and france and raged with only a slight intermission until 1815  england and france both ravaged american commerce  but england was the more serious offender because she had command of the seas  though jefferson and madison strove for peace  the country was swept into war by the vehemence of the  young republicans   headed by clay and calhoun  when the armed conflict was closed  one in diplomacy opened  the autocratic powers of europe threatened to intervene on behalf of spain in her attempt to recover possession of her latin american colonies  their challenge to america brought forth the monroe doctrine  the powers of europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new colonization in it  it seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful triumph over sectionalism   references  h  adams   history of the united states  1800 1817   9 vols    k c  babcock   rise of american nationality

undemocratic  the democracy of jefferson was  in the beginning  provincial  the historic mission of uniting nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders from a region beyond the mountains  peopled by men and women from all sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the early days of colonization  the voice of the democratic nationalism nourished in the west was heard when clay of kentucky advocated his american system of protection for industries  when jackson of tennessee condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its place among the great american state papers  and when lincoln of illinois  in a fateful hour  called upon a bewildered people to meet the supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish  and it will be remembered that lincoln s party chose for its banner that earlier device  republican  which jefferson had made a sign of power  the  rail splitter  from illinois united the nationalism of hamilton with the democracy of jefferson  and his appeal was clothed in the simple language of the people  not in the sonorous rhetoric which webster learned in the schools  preparation for western settlement  the west and the american revolution    the excessive attention devoted by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured the role played by the frontier in the american revolution  the action of great britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence  americans on the frontier did not forget it  when indians were employed by england to defend that land  zeal for the patriot cause set the interior aflame  it was the members of the western vanguard  like daniel boone  john sevier  and george rogers clark  who first understood the value of the far away country under the guns of the english forts  where the red men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife  it was they who gave the east no rest until their vision was seen by the leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy  it was one of their number  a seasoned indian fighter  george rogers clark  who with aid from virginia seized kaskaskia and vincennes and secured the whole northwest to the union while the fate of washington s army was still hanging in the balance   western problems at the end of the revolution    the treaty of peace  signed with great britain in 1783  brought the definite cession of the coveted territory west to the mississippi river  but it left unsolved many problems  in the first place  tribes of resentful indians in the ohio region  even though british support was withdrawn at last  had to be reckoned with  and it was not until after the establishment of the federal constitution that a well equipped army could be provided to guarantee peace on the border  in the second place  british garrisons still occupied forts on lake erie pending the execution of the terms of the treaty of 1783  terms which were not fulfilled until after the ratification of the jay treaty twelve years later  in the third place  virginia  connecticut  and massachusetts had conflicting claims to the land in the northwest based on old english charters and indian treaties  it was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement to transfer their rights to the government of the united states  virginia executing her deed of cession on march 1  1784  in the fourth place  titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the absence of official maps and records  to meet this last situation  congress instituted a systematic survey of the ohio country  laying it out into townships  sections of 640 acres each  and quarter sections  in every township one section of land was set aside for the support of public schools   the northwest ordinance    the final problem which had to be solved before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing the territory  pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile valley of the ohio could hardly restrain their impatience  soldiers of the revolution  who had been paid for their services in land warrants entitling them to make entries in the west  called for action  congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous northwest ordinance providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free males in any district  eventual admission to the union on an equal footing with the original states was promised to the new territories  religious freedom was guaranteed  the safeguards of trial by jury  regular judicial procedure  and  habeas corpus  were established  in order that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the rough and ready justice of lynch law  during the course of the debate on the ordinance  congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and involuntary servitude  this charter of the northwest  so well planned by the congress under the articles of confederation  was continued in force by the first congress under the constitution in 1789  the following year its essential provisions  except the ban on slavery  were applied to the territory south of the ohio  ceded by north carolina to the national government  and in 1798 to the mississippi territory  once held by georgia  thus it was settled for all time that  the new colonies were not to be exploited for the benefit of the parent states  any more than for the benefit of england  but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths   this outcome  bitterly opposed by some eastern leaders who feared the triumph of western states over the seaboard  completed the legal steps necessary by way of preparation for the flood of settlers   the land companies  speculators  and western land tenure    as in the original settlement of america  so in the opening of the west  great companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured  in 1787 the ohio land company  a new england concern  acquired a million and a half acres on the ohio and began operations by planting the town of marietta  a professional land speculator  j c  symmes  secured a million acres lower down where the city of cincinnati was founded  other individuals bought up soldiers  claims and so acquired enormous holdings for speculative purposes  indeed  there was such a rush to make fortunes quickly through the rise in land values that washington was moved to cry out against the  rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the north west of the ohio   protesting that  scarce a valuable spot within any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant   he therefore urged congress to fix a reasonable price for the land  not  too exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers  but high enough to discourage monopolizers   congress  however  was not prepared to use the public domain for the sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the west  it still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of revenue with which to pay off the public debt  consequently it thought more of instant income than of ultimate results  it placed no limit on the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at  2 an acre in 1796  and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small registration and survey fee  on such terms a speculator with a few thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land  if he was fortunate in disposing of it  he could meet the installments  which were spread over a period of four years  and make a handsome profit for himself  even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in 1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of  1 75 an acre  the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract capital to land ventures   the development of the small freehold    the cheapness of land and the scarcity of labor  nevertheless  made impossible the triumph of the huge estate with its semi servile tenantry  for about  45 a man could get a farm of 160 acres on the installment plan  another payment of  80 was due in forty days  but a four year term was allowed for the discharge of the balance  with a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a family could embark on a land venture  if it had good crops  it could meet the deferred payments  it was  however  a hard battle at best  many a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment  yet in the end  in spite of all the handicaps  the small freehold of a few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of western agriculture  except in the planting states of the gulf  even the lands of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots  the tendency toward moderate holdings  so favored by western conditions  was also promoted by a clause in the northwest ordinance declaring that the land of any person dying intestate  that is  without any will disposing of it  should be divided equally among his descendants  hildreth says of this provision   it established the important republican principle  not then introduced into all the states  of the equal distribution of landed as well as personal property   all these forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth  in the early days of the nineteenth century  an american characteristic  in marked contrast with the european system of family prestige and vast estates based on the law of primogeniture  the western migration and new states  the people    with government established  federal arms victorious over the indians  and the lands surveyed for sale  the way was prepared for the immigrants  they came with a rush  young new englanders  weary of tilling the stony soil of their native states  poured through new york and pennsylvania  some settling on the northern bank of the ohio but most of them in the lake region  sons and daughters of german farmers in pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of servitude pressed out into ohio  kentucky  tennessee  or beyond  from the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the southern states came pioneers of english and scotch irish descent  the latter in great numbers  indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that  the rapid expansion of the united states from a coast strip to a continental area is largely a scotch irish achievement   while native americans of mixed stocks led the way into the west  it was not long before immigrants direct from europe  under the stimulus of company enterprise  began to filter into the new settlements in increasing numbers  the types of people were as various as the nations they represented  timothy flint  who published his entertaining  recollections  in 1826  found the west a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people  some of them  he relates  had been hunters in the upper world of the mississippi  above the falls of st  anthony  some had been still farther north  in canada  still others had wandered from the south  the gulf of mexico  the red river  and the spanish country  french boatmen and trappers  spanish traders from the southwest  virginia planters with their droves of slaves mingled with english  german  and scotch irish farmers  hunters  forest rangers  restless bordermen  and squatters  like the foaming combers of an advancing tide  went first  then followed the farmers  masters of the ax and plow  with their wives who shared every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of civilized life  the hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes  the home makers built for all time   the number of immigrants    there were no official stations on the frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the west during the decades following the american revolution  but travelers of the time record that every road was  crowded  with pioneers and their families  their wagons and cattle  and that they were seldom out of the sound of the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack of the hunter s rifle as he brought down his evening meal   during the latter half of 1787   says coman   more than nine hundred boats floated down the ohio carrying eighteen thousand men  women  and children  and twelve thousand horses  sheep  and cattle  and six hundred and fifty wagons   other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher   the western routes    four main routes led into the country beyond the appalachians  the genesee road  beginning at albany  ran almost due west to the present site of buffalo on lake erie  through a level country  in the dry season  wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into northern ohio  a second route  through pittsburgh  was fed by three eastern branches  one starting at philadelphia  one at baltimore  and another at alexandria  a third main route wound through the mountains from alexandria to boonesboro in kentucky and then westward across the ohio to st  louis  a fourth  the most famous of them all  passed through the cumberland gap and by branches extended into the cumberland valley and the kentucky country  of these four lines of travel  the pittsburgh route offered the most advantages  pioneers  no matter from what section they came  when once they were on the headwaters of the ohio and in possession of a flatboat  could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the west and southwest  whether they wanted to settle in ohio  kentucky  or western tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their destination or at least to some spot near it  many people from the south as well as the northern and middle states chose this route  so it came about that the sons and daughters of virginia and the carolinas mingled with those of new york  pennsylvania  and new england in the settlement of the northwest territory   the methods of travel into the west    many stories giving exact descriptions of methods of travel into the west in the early days have been preserved  the country was hardly opened before visitors from the old world and from the eastern states  impelled by curiosity  made their way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or amuse the public  one of them  gilbert imlay  an english traveler  has given us an account of the pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791   if a man       he writes   has a family or goods of any sort to remove  his best way  then  would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to carry his property to redstone old fort or to pittsburgh  according as he may come from the northern or southern states  a good waggon will cost  at philadelphia  about  10     and the horses about  12 each  they would cost something more both at baltimore and alexandria  the waggon may be covered with canvass  and if it is the choice of the people  they may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety  but if they dislike that  there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the different roads     the provisions i would purchase in the same manner  that is  from the farmers along the road   and by having two or three camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress their own food     this manner of journeying is so far from being disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant   the immigrant once at pittsburgh or wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a size required for his goods and stock  and drift down the current to his journey s end   illustration  roads and trails into the western territory   the admission of kentucky and tennessee    when the eighteenth century drew to a close  kentucky had a population larger than delaware  rhode island  or new hampshire  tennessee claimed 60 000 inhabitants  in 1792 kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent  virginia  the eastern federalists resented her intrusion  but they took some consolation in the admission of vermont because the balance of eastern power was still retained  as if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas the makers of kentucky s first constitution swept aside the landed qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males  four years later  kentucky s neighbor to the south  tennessee  followed this step toward a wider democracy  after encountering fierce opposition from the federalists  tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state   ohio    the door of the union had hardly opened for tennessee when another appeal was made to congress  this time from the pioneers in ohio  the little posts founded at marietta and cincinnati had grown into flourishing centers of trade  the stream of immigrants  flowing down the river  added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for  store goods   after the indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last british soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the jay treaty of 1795  tiny settlements of families appeared on lake erie in the  western reserve   a region that had been retained by connecticut when she surrendered her other rights in the northwest  at the close of the century  ohio  claiming a population of more than 50 000  grew discontented with its territorial status  indeed  two years before the enactment of the northwest ordinance  squatters in that region had been invited by one john emerson to hold a convention after the fashion of the men of hartford  windsor  and wethersfield in old connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves  this true son of new england declared that men  have an undoubted right to pass into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that from the confederation of the whole united states congress is not empowered to forbid them   this grand convention was never held because the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders  but the spirit of john emerson did not perish  in november  1802  a convention chosen by voters  assembled under the authority of congress at chillicothe  drew up a constitution  it went into force after a popular ratification  the roll of the convention bore such names as abbot  baldwin  cutler  huntington  putnam  and sargent  and the list of counties from which they came included adams  fairfield  hamilton  jefferson  trumbull  and washington  showing that the new america in the west was peopled and led by the old stock  in 1803 ohio was admitted to the union   indiana and illinois    as in the neighboring state  the frontier in indiana advanced northward from the ohio  mainly under the leadership  however  of settlers from the south  restless kentuckians hoping for better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of virginia and north carolina  as soon as a tier of counties swinging upward like the horns of the moon against ohio on the east and in the wabash valley on the west was fairly settled  a clamor went up for statehood  under the authority of an act of congress in 1816 the indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at corydon   the majority of the members of the convention   we are told by a local historian   were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues put it into shape   two years later  the pioneers of illinois  also settled upward from the ohio  like indiana  elected their delegates to draft a constitution  leadership in the convention  quite properly  was taken by a man born in new york and reared in tennessee  and the constitution as finally drafted  was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing constitutions of kentucky  ohio  and indiana     many of the articles are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and numbered    louisiana  mississippi  and alabama    across the mississippi to the far south  clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and enterprise  the cotton and sugar lands of louisiana  opened by french and spanish settlers  were widened in every direction by planters with their armies of slaves from the older states  new orleans  a good market and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer  grew apace  in 1810 the population of lower louisiana was over 75 000  the time had come  said the leaders of the people  to fulfill the promise made to france in the treaty of cession  namely  to grant to the inhabitants of the territory statehood and the rights of american citizens  federalists from new england still having a voice in congress  if somewhat weaker  still protested in tones of horror   i am compelled to declare it as my deliberate opinion   pronounced josiah quincy in the house of representatives   that if this bill  to admit louisiana  passes  the bonds of this union are virtually dissolved     that as it will be the right of all  so it will be the duty of some  states  to prepare definitely for a separation  amicably if they can  violently if they must     it is a death blow to the constitution  it may afterwards linger  but lingering  its fate will  at no very distant period  be consummated   federalists from new york like those from new england had their doubts about the wisdom of admitting western states  but the party of jefferson and madison  having the necessary majority  granted the coveted statehood to louisiana in 1812  when  a few years later  mississippi and alabama knocked at the doors of the union  the federalists had so little influence  on account of their conduct during the second war with england  that spokesmen from the southwest met a kindlier reception at washington  mississippi  in 1817  and alabama  in 1819  took their places among the united states of america  both of them  while granting white manhood suffrage  gave their constitutions the tone of the old east by providing landed qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature   missouri    far to the north in the louisiana purchase  a new commonwealth was rising to power  it was peopled by immigrants who came down the ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the mississippi from kentucky and tennessee  thrifty germans from pennsylvania  hardy farmers from virginia ready to work with their own hands  freemen seeking freemen s homes  planters with their slaves moving on from worn out fields on the seaboard  came together in the widening settlements of the missouri country  peoples from the north and south flowed together  small farmers and big planters mingling in one community  when their numbers had reached sixty thousand or more  they precipitated a contest over their admission to the union   ringing an alarm bell in the night   as jefferson phrased it  the favorite expedient of compromise with slavery was brought forth in congress once more  maine consequently was brought into the union without slavery and missouri with slavery  at the same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the louisiana territory a line separating servitude from slavery  the spirit of the frontier  land tenure and liberty    over an immense western area there developed an unbroken system of freehold farms  in the gulf states and the lower mississippi valley  it is true  the planter with his many slaves even led in the pioneer movement  but through large sections of tennessee and kentucky  as well as upper georgia and alabama  and all throughout the northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme  in this immense dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class  a body of people all having about the same amount of this world s goods and deriving their livelihood from one source  the labor of their own hands on the soil  the northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all the original thirteen states combined  except georgia  and its system of agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates   in the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition   as webster said on more than one occasion   lay the true basis  most certainly  of popular government   there was the undoubted source of jacksonian democracy   illustration  a log cabin  lincoln s birthplace   the characteristics of the western people    travelers into the northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the characteristics common to an independent yeomanry  a close observer thus recorded his impressions   a spirit of adventurous enterprise  a willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object     independence of thought and action  they have felt the influence of these principles from their childhood  men who can endure anything  that have lived almost without restraint  free as the mountain air or as the deer and the buffalo of their forests  and who know they are americans all     an apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of manner     where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people who know little about each other s previous history or ancestry but where each is lord of the soil he cultivates  where a log cabin is all that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in creating a diversity of rank in society  these circumstances have laid the foundation for that equality of intercourse  simplicity of manners  want of deference  want of reserve  great readiness to make acquaintances  freedom of speech  indisposition to brook real or imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the west   this equality  this independence  this rudeness so often described by the traveler as marking a new country  were all accentuated by the character of the settlers themselves  traces of the fierce  unsociable  eagle eyed  hard drinking hunter remained  the settlers who followed the hunter were  with some exceptions  soldiers of the revolutionary army  farmers of the  middling order   and mechanics from the towns   english  scotch irish  germans   poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of their own hands for support  sons and daughters from well to do eastern homes sometimes brought softer manners  but the equality of life and the leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit with their struggling neighbors  even the preachers and teachers  who came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and schoolhouses were built  preached sermons and taught lessons that savored of the frontier  as any one may know who reads peter cartwright s  a muscular christian  or eggleston s  the hoosier schoolmaster   the west and the east meet  the east alarmed    a people so independent as the westerners and so attached to local self government gave the conservative east many a rude shock  setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with the idea that terrible things might happen in the mississippi valley  not without good grounds did washington fear that  a touch of a feather would turn  the western settlers away from the seaboard to the spaniards  and seriously did he urge the east not to neglect them  lest they be  drawn into the arms of  or be dependent upon foreigners   taking advantage of the restless spirit in the southwest  aaron burr  having disgraced himself by killing alexander hamilton in a duel  laid wild plans  if not to bring about a secession in that region  at least to build a state of some kind out of the spanish dominions adjoining louisiana  frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of the west  the federalists  with a few conspicuous exceptions  opposed equality between the sections  had their narrow views prevailed  the west  with its new democracy  would have been held in perpetual tutelage to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen colonies had been not long before   eastern friends of the west    fortunately for the nation  there were many eastern leaders  particularly from the south  who understood the west  approved its spirit  and sought to bring the two sections together by common bonds  washington kept alive and keen the zeal for western advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor  he never grew tired of urging upon his eastern friends the importance of the lands beyond the mountains  he pressed upon the governor of virginia a project for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the ohio country and was active in a movement to improve the navigation of the potomac  he advocated strengthening the ties of commerce   smooth the roads   he said   and make easy the way for them  and then see what an influx of articles will be poured upon us  how amazingly our exports will be increased by them  and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble and expense we may encounter to effect it   jefferson  too  was interested in every phase of western development  the survey of lands  the exploration of waterways  the opening of trade  and even the discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals  robert fulton  the inventor of the steamboat  was another man of vision who for many years pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting east and west by a canal which would cement the union  raise the value of the public lands  and extend the principles of confederate and republican government   the difficulties of early transportation    means of communication played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to bring together the seaboard and the frontier  the produce of the west  wheat  corn  bacon  hemp  cattle  and tobacco  was bulky and the cost of overland transportation was prohibitive  in the eastern market   a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt  while a suit of  store clothes  cost as much as a farm   in such circumstances  the inhabitants of the mississippi valley were forced to ship their produce over a long route by way of new orleans and to pay high freight rates for everything that was brought across the mountains  scows of from five to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down the stream to the crescent city  in a few cases small ocean going vessels were built to transport goods to the west indies or to the eastern coast towns  salt  iron  guns  powder  and the absolute essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in eastern markets were carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the rainy season   the national road    to far sighted men  like albert gallatin   the father of internal improvements   the solution of this problem was the construction of roads and canals  early in jefferson s administration  congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying into the atlantic to the ohio river and beyond into the northwest territory  in 1806  after many misgivings  it authorized a great national highway binding the east and the west  the cumberland road  as it was called  began in northwestern maryland  wound through southern pennsylvania  crossed the narrow neck of virginia at wheeling  and then shot almost straight across ohio  indiana  and illinois  into missouri  by 1817  stagecoaches were running between washington and wheeling  by 1833 contractors had carried their work to columbus  ohio  and by 1852  to vandalia  illinois  over this ballasted road mail and passenger coaches could go at high speed  and heavy freight wagons proceed in safety at a steady pace   illustration  the cumberland road   canals and steamboats    a second epoch in the economic union of the east and west was reached with the opening of the erie canal in 1825  offering an all water route from new york city to the great lakes and the mississippi valley  pennsylvania  alarmed by the advantages conferred on new york by this enterprise  began her system of canals and portages from philadelphia to pittsburgh  completing the last link in 1834  in the south  the chesapeake and ohio company  chartered in 1825  was busy with a project to connect georgetown and cumberland when railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished  about the same time  ohio built a canal across the state  affording water communication between lake erie and the ohio river through a rich wheat belt  passengers could now travel by canal boat into the west with comparative ease and comfort  if not at a rapid speed  and the bulkiest of freight could be easily handled  moreover  the rate charged for carrying goods was cut by the erie canal from  32 a ton per hundred miles to  1  new orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the mississippi valley  the diversion of traffic to eastern markets was also stimulated by steamboats which appeared on the ohio about 1810  three years after fulton had made his famous trip on the hudson  it took twenty men to sail and row a five ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to twenty miles a day  in 1825  timothy flint traveled a hundred miles a day on the new steamer  grecian   against the whole weight of the mississippi current   three years later the round trip from louisville to new orleans was cut to eight days  heavy produce that once had to float down to new orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the east by way of the canal systems   illustration   from an old print  an early mississippi steamboat  thus the far country was brought near  the timid no longer hesitated at the thought of the perilous journey  all routes were crowded with western immigrants  the forests fell before the ax like grain before the sickle  clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great mosaic of farms stretching from the southern appalachians to lake michigan  the national census of 1830 gave 937 000 inhabitants to ohio  343 000 to indiana  157 000 to illinois  687 000 to kentucky  and 681 000 to tennessee   illustration  distribution of population  1830  with the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came political influence  people who had once petitioned congress now sent their own representatives  men who had hitherto accepted without protests presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent in 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for john quincy adams  and four years later they sent a son of the soil from tennessee  andrew jackson  to take washington s chair as chief executive of the nation  the first of a long line of presidents from the mississippi basin   references  w g  brown   the lower south in

convention  prophesied that in time the west would dominate the east   at the adoption of the constitution   they said   a certain balance of power among the original states was considered to exist  and there was at that time and yet is among those parties a strong affinity between their great and general interests  by the admission of these  new  states that balance has been materially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately be destroyed  the southern states will first avail themselves of their new confederates to govern the east  and finally the western states  multiplied in number  and augmented in population  will control the interests of the whole   strangely enough the fulfillment of this prophecy was being prepared even in federalist strongholds by the rise of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers beyond the mountains  the democratic movement in the east  the aristocratic features of the old order    the revolutionary fathers  in setting up their first state constitutions  although they often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed  did not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males  on the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe  depositary  of political power  they went back to the colonial tradition that related taxation and representation  this  they argued  was not only just but a safeguard against the  excesses of democracy   in carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or property qualifications on the right to vote  broadly speaking  these limitations fell into three classes  three states  pennsylvania  1776   new hampshire  1784   and georgia  1798   gave the ballot to all who paid taxes  without reference to the value of their property  three  virginia  delaware  and rhode island  clung firmly to the ancient principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral rights  still other states  while closely restricting the suffrage  accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of the requirements  in massachusetts  for instance  the vote was granted to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or possessed other property worth sixty pounds  the electors thus enfranchised  numerous as they were  owing to the wide distribution of land  often suffered from a very onerous disability  in many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers  in new hampshire  the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds  one half in land  in massachusetts  one thousand pounds  all freehold  in maryland  five thousand pounds  one thousand of which was freehold  in north carolina  one thousand pounds freehold  and in south carolina  ten thousand pounds freehold  a state senator in massachusetts had to be the owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property worth six hundred pounds  in new jersey  one thousand pounds  worth of property  in north carolina  three hundred acres of land  in south carolina  two thousand pounds freehold  for members of the lower house of the legislature lower qualifications were required  in most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were further restricted by religious provisions  no single sect was powerful enough to dominate after the revolution  but  for the most part  catholics and jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office  north carolina and georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a protestant  delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the trinity and the inspiration of the scriptures  massachusetts and maryland limited it to christians  virginia and new york  advanced for their day  made no discrimination in government on account of religious opinion   the defense of the old order    it must not be supposed that property qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of little consequence in practice  in the beginning they were viewed as fundamental  as towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens increased  the restrictions were defended with even more vigor  in massachusetts  the great webster upheld the rights of property in government  saying   it is entirely just that property should have its due weight and consideration in political arrangements     the disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed  those political thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society to their deepest foundations  have been revolutions against property   in pennsylvania  a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage   what does the delegate propose  to place the vicious vagrant  the wandering arabs  the tartar hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man   in virginia  jefferson himself had first believed in property qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the  mobs of the great cities   it was near the end of the eighteenth century before he accepted the idea of manhood suffrage  even then he was unable to convince the constitution makers of his own state   it is not an idle chimera of the brain   urged one of them   that the possession of land furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent  common interest with  and attachment to  the community     it is upon this foundation i wish to place the right of suffrage  this is the best general standard which can be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be  consistently with the safety and well being of the community  intrusted with the exercise of that right    attacks on the restricted suffrage    the changing circumstances of american life  however  soon challenged the rule of those with property  prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business interests  where the freehold qualification was applied  business men who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office  in new york  for example  the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred pounds  worth of land could vote for state senator and governor  while the landless banker or merchant could not  it is not surprising  therefore  to find business men taking the lead in breaking down freehold limitations on the suffrage  the professional classes also were interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from public affairs  it was a schoolmaster  thomas dorr  who led the popular uprising in rhode island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders to an end  in addition to the business and professional classes  the mechanics of the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that generally barred them from voting or holding office  though not numerous  they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of public affairs  they had led the riots against the stamp act  overturned king george s statue  and  crammed stamps down the throats of collectors   when the state constitutions were framed they took a lively
